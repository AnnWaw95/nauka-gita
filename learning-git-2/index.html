            <p>
                When I was a young boy living in the city 
                <br>All I did was run, run, run, run, run 
                <br>Staring at the lights, they look so pretty 
                <br>Momma said, "Son, son, son, son, son" 
                <br>"You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old"
                <br>"All that glitters don't turn to gold"
                <br>"But until then, just have your fun"
                <br>"Boy, run, run, run, run, run"
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah, run, run, run
                <br>Run, run, run
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was a young kid living in the city
                <br>All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
                <br>And every single dime that good Lord gave me
                <br>I could make it last three, four, five days
                <br>Living it up but living down low
                <br>Chasing that luck before I get old
                <br>And looking back, oh, we had some fun
                <br>Boy, run, run, run, run, run
            </p>
            <p>
                They tell you that the sky might fall
                <br>They'll say that you might lose it all
                <br>So I run until I hit that wall
                <br>Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
                <br>Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
            </p>
            <p>
                Yeah, one day well the sky might fall
                <br>Yeah, one day I could lose it all
                <br>So I run until I hit that wall
                <br>If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
                <br>Look to the rising sun and run, run, run
            </p>
            <p>
                Run, run, run
            </p>
            <p>
                Didn't get everything that I wanted
                <br>But I got what I need, yeah, yeah
                <br>I see that light in the morning
                <br>Shining down on me
                <br>So take me up high, take me down low
                <br>Where it all ends nobody knows
                <br>But until then let's have some fun
                <br>Yeah, run, run, run, run, run
            </p>
            <p>
